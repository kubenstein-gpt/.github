# Kubenstein

## Concept

The name "Kubenstein" is a play of words on Kubernetes and Frankenstein.

The goal of project  Kubenstein-GPT is to explore the effectiveness of an artificial system administrator in dealing with open-ended system problems, by mediating communications between a generative AI and a Kubernetes cluster.

This GitHub organization contains projects representing the components and tools that deliver on that concept.
